 * I did not reverse this myself and previously had no idea how you would go about
 * detecting KiAttachProcess so credits to KANKOSHEV for the find:
 *
 * https://github.com/KANKOSHEV/Detect-KeAttachProcess/tree/main
 * https://doxygen.reactos.org/d0/dc9/procobj_8c.html#adec6dc539d4a5c0ee7d0f48e24ef0933
 *
 * To expand on his writeup a little, the offset that he provides is equivalent to
 * PKAPC_STATE->Process. This is where KiAttachProcess writes the process that thread is attaching
 * to when it's called. The APC_STATE structure holds relevant information about the thread's APC
 * state and is quite important during context switch scenarios as it's how the thread determines if
 * it has any APC's queued.
